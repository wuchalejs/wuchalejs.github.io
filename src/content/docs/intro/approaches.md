title: Comparing i18n Approaches

Internationalization tools make distinct trade-offs between developer
convenience, explicit control, and maintenance overhead. Understanding these
approaches helps you choose the right tool for your project's needs and team
preferences.

## The Three Approaches

### Manual Key Management

Developers should have complete control over translation keys, catalog
structure, and the translation process.

**How it works**:
- Developers define translation keys and manage catalog files manually
- Code references translations by these predefined keys
- Maximum control and predictability

**Tools in this category**: `i18next`, `react-i18next`, `React-intl`, `Paraglide`, `next-intl`, `typesafe-i18n`, `vue-i18n`, `svelte-i18n`

**Example**:
```jsx
// Traditional approach
<p>{t('pages.home.greeting', {username})}</p>

// Paraglide approach
<p>{m.welcome_message({username})}</p>

// React-intl approach
<p><FormattedMessage id="greeting" values={{username}} /></p>
```

**Pros**:
- Complete developer control
- Highly predictable behavior  
- Easy to understand and debug

**Cons**:
- High maintenance overhead
- Manual catalog management prone to key rot
- Verbose code with opaque keys
- Significant effort to add i18n to existing projects

**Consider this approach when**:
- Maximum control over translation keys and structure is a priority
- There are complex translation workflows or requirements that cannot be met by other means
- The team prefers explicit over implicit behavior

### Explicit Marking + Automatic Extraction

Developers should explicitly mark translatable content, but tooling should
handle the extraction and catalog management.

**How it works**:
- Developers wrap translatable strings in specific components or function calls
- Tools automatically extract marked strings into translation catalogs
- Balance between explicit control and automated workflow

**Tools in this category**: `Lingui`

**Example**:
```jsx
// Lingui approach
<p><Trans>Hello {username}!</Trans></p>
```

**Pros**:
- Clear developer intent - obvious what gets translated
- Predictable behavior
- Automatic catalog generation and maintenance

**Cons**:
- Requires modifying existing code
- More verbose source code
- Learning curve for framework-specific components/functions

**Consider this approach when**:
- Balance between automation and control is desired
- Clear visibility of what gets translated is a must
- The team is comfortable with some boilerplate for obvious predictability

### Full Automation

The tooling should automatically detect what needs translation without
requiring developers to change their code.

**How it works**: 
- AST analysis identifies user-facing text based on context
- No explicit marking or special syntax required in source code
- Developers write natural code; the tool handles internationalization

**Example**:

```svelte
<p>Hello {username}!</p>
```

**Tools in this category**: **`Wuchale`**

**Pros**:
- Zero boilerplate, easy to add to existing projects
- Clean, readable source code
- Low barrier to internationalization adoption

**Cons**:
- Not having to specify anything may feel uncomfortable for some developers

**Consider this approach when**:
- Adding i18n to existing projects with minimal code changes
- The team values clean, readable source code
- The team is comfortable with intelligent tooling making decisions

## Choosing the right approach

Each approach represents a valid solution to different priorities. The "best"
choice depends on your specific context: team size, project constraints,
existing codebase, translation workflow complexity, and philosophical
preferences about tooling automation versus explicit control.

Understanding these trade-offs helps you make an informed decision rather than
defaulting to familiar approaches or the latest trends.
