These are not concrete goals set in stone. They are subject to change based on
circumstances and feedback. And feedback is welcome.

## Additional support

`wuchale` already has three adapters: the Vanilla, JSX and Svelte adapters,
with two ways of using them: CLI and a Vite plugin. Additional support is
planned for:

- Next.js

## LSP server

During development, it would be nice if the string we are writing will be extracted
or not, right from the editor. This will be implemented.
