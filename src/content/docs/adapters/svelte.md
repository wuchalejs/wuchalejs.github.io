## Setup in Your App

Svelte applications may or may not use SvelteKit and that makes the loading of
the compiled catalogs a bit different. `wuchale` tries to detect whether
SvelteKit is in use and write the suitable default loader. Assuming it was
correct, follow the following steps. If it was wrong, edit the loader file
first.

### For SvelteKit (SSR/SSG)

```javascript
// src/routes/+layout.js
import { locales } from 'virtual:wuchale/locales'
import { loadCatalogs } from 'wuchale/run-client'
import { loadIDs, loadCatalog } from '../locales/loader.svelte.js'

export const prerender = true

/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutLoad} */
export async function load({url}) {
    const locale = url.searchParams.get('locale') ?? 'en'
    if (!(locale in locales)) {
        return
    }
    return {
        locale,
        catalogs: await loadCatalogs(locale, loadIDs, loadCatalog)
    }
}
```

### For Svelte (SPA)

```svelte
<!-- src/App.svelte -->
<script>
  import { loadLocale } from 'wuchale/run-client'
  import Counter from './lib/Counter.svelte'

  let locale = $state('en')
</script>

{#await loadLocale(locale)}
    <!-- @wc-ignore -->
    Loading translations...
{:then}
    <!-- Your app content -->
{/await}
```

## Behavior Explanation (Svelte adapter)

### What Gets Extracted?

This is decided by the heuristic function which you can customize. A sensible
default heuristic function is provided out of the box. Here's how it works:

#### General rule (applies everywhere):
- If the message contains no letters used in any natural language (e.g., just numbers or symbols), it is ignored.

#### In `markup` (`<p>Text</p>`):
- All textual content is extracted.

Examples:

```svelte
<p>This is extracted</p>
<!-- @wc-ignore -->
<p>This is not extracted</p>
```

#### In `attribute` (`<div title="Info">`):
- If the first character is a lowercase English letter (`[a-z]`), it is ignored.
- If the element is a `<path>`, it is ignored (e.g., for SVG `d="M10 10..."` attributes).
- Otherwise, it is extracted.

Examples:

```svelte
<img alt="Profile Picture" class="not-extracted" />
```

#### In `script` (`<script>` and `.svelte.js/ts`):

`script` is handled by the ES adapter of the core package with some additional restrictions.
- If it doesn't pass the base heuristic from the ES adapter, it is ignored.
- If it's not inside `$derived` or `$derived.by`, it is ignored.
- If the value is inside `$inspect()` calls, it is ignored.
- Otherwise, it is extracted.

Examples:

```javascript
// In $derived or functions
const message = $derived('This is extracted')
const lowercase = $derived('not extracted')

// Force extraction with comment
const forced = $derived(/* @wc-include */ 'force extracted')
```
```svelte
<p title={'Extracted'}>{/* @wc-ignore */ 'Ignore this'}</p>
```

If you need more control, you can supply your own heuristic function in the
configuration. Custom heuristics can return `undefined` or `null` to fall back
to the default. For convenience, the default heuristic is exported by the
package.

> ðŸ’¡ You can override extraction with comment directives:
> - `@wc-ignore` â€” skips extraction
> - `@wc-include` â€” forces extraction  
> These always take precedence.

## Configuration Reference

For the main configuration, look in the [configuration reference](/reference/config).

For the common adapter configuration, look in the [common adapter options](/reference/adapter-common/).

### `bundleLoad`
**type**: `boolean`
**default**: `false`

In some cases, avoiding async loading and directly importing the
catalogs by the code that uses them may be desired. This is how Paraglide
works. However, it is not recommended as all catalogs then get bundled with
the code that uses them even though only one is required by the user. This
can inflate the bundle side. But if this is desired anyway, it can be
enabled here.
