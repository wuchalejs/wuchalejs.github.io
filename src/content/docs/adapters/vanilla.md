## Behavior Explanation

### What Gets Extracted?

This is decided by the heuristic function which you can customize. A sensible
default heuristic function is provided out of the box. Here's how it works:

- If the text contains no letters used in any natural language (e.g., just numbers or symbols), it is ignored.
- If it's in a top-level expression (not inside an assignment or a function definition) it is ignored.
- If the value is inside `console.*()` call, it is ignored.
- If the first character is a lowercase English letter (`[a-z]`) or is any non-letter, it is ignored.
- Otherwise, it is extracted.

Examples:

```javascript

const message = 'This is extracted'
const lowercase = 'not extracted'

// Force extraction with comment
const forced = /* @wc-include */ 'force extracted'

function foo() {
    const extracted = 'Hello!'
}
```

If you need more control, you can supply your own heuristic function in the
configuration. Custom heuristics can return `undefined` or `null` to fall back
to the default. For convenience, the default heuristic is exported by the
package.

> ðŸ’¡ You can override extraction with comment directives:
> - `@wc-ignore` â€” skips extraction
> - `@wc-include` â€” forces extraction  
> These always take precedence.

## Configuration Reference

For the main configuration, look in the [configuration reference](/reference/config).

```javascript

import { adapter as vanillaAdapter } from "wuchale/adapter-vanilla"

const vanillaAdapterConf = vanillaAdapter({
    // Where to store translation files. {locale} will be replaced with the respective locale.
    catalog: './src/locales/{locale}',
    
    // Files to scan for translations and transform
    files: ['src/**/*.{js,ts}'],
    
    // Custom extraction logic
    // signature should be: (text: string, details: object) => boolean | undefined
    // details has the following properties:
        // scope: "markup" | "attribute" | "script",
        // declaring?: "variable" | "function" | "expression",
        // insideFuncDef?: boolean,
        // topLevelCall?: string,
        // call?: string,
        // element?: string,
        // attribute?: string,
        // file?: string,
    heuristic: defaultHeuristic,

    // Whether to split the compiled catalogs into even smaller files
    granularLoad: false,

    // When using granularLoad, generate a load ID for each file. The ID should
    // be like a keyword, only [a-zA-Z0-9_] are allowed. You can return the same
    // ID to group compiled catalogs to prevent too much splitting
    generateLoadID: defaultGenerateLoadID,

    // Write content that would be virtual to disk
    writeFiles: {
        // the compiled catalogs
        compiled: false,
        // the catalogs proxy
        proxy: false,
        // the transformed code
        transformed: false,
        // Output directory for the transformed code.
        outDir: 'src/locales/.output'
    },

    // By default, the runtime instance variable is initialized on the top
    // level. But this may make the new content not available on reload unless the
    // server is restarted. Use this to avoid that problem by initializing the
    // runtime variable inside each function definition.
    initInsideFunc,

    // Your plural function name
    pluralFunc: 'plural',
})
```
