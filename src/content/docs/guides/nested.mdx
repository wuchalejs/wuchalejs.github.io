title: Mixed and nested structures
---

While simple messages are easy to extract, mixed and nested messages are
not. But `wuchale` handles them seamlessly. When writing them in the [`.po`
files](/concepts/catalogs/#po-files), it uses a simple convention that is easy
to work with for translators.

## Text mixed with expressions

These are created when extracting template literals and markup message with
expressions in the middle. For example,

```js
const msg = `Hello ${userName}, welcome to ${appName}!`
```

And

```svelte
<p>Hello {userName}, welcome to ${appName}!</p>
```

Are both extracted into the catalogs:

```po
msgid "Hello {0}, welcome to {1}!"
msgstr ""
```

Then it gets compiled into the optimized form to require as few operations as
possible to render:

```js
export let c = [["Hello ", 0, ", welcome to ", 1, "!"]]
```

And the code is turned into a version that gets it by index (in this case `0`)
and give it the dynamic values in the same order:

```js
const msg = _w_runtime_.t(0, [userName, appName])
```
And
```svelte
<p>{_w_runtime_.t(0, [userName, appName])}</p>
```

This makes the job of the [`Runtime.t`
method](https://github.com/wuchalejs/wuchale/blob/main/packages/wuchale/src/runtime.ts)
very simple during runtime. No replace, no weird regex. Just concatenate in the
order getting the references by index and return.

And this enables it to accomodate any change in the translation. If the
translator changes the order of things, it will just follow and use the that
order.

## Nested content (advanced)

Text mixed with markup that contains other text or expressions:

```svelte
<p>Welcome to <i>the app {appName}</i>, <b>{userName}</b>!</p>
```

This is extracted as:

```po
msgid "Welcome to <0>the app {0}</0>, <1/>!"
msgstr ""
```

This example shows two behaviours `wuchale` has when handling nesting content.

- When the nested content contains only text or text mixed with something else,
    it is extracted in numeric HTML-like tags with both opening and closing tags
    `<0>...</0>`.
- When it doesn't contain any text, the whole thing is extracted as a
    self-closing numeric tag `<1/>`. Because the translator doesn't need to know
    what is inside the tag because it is not translatable. They can translated
    without being overwhelmed with unnecessary details.

**Note**: The numeric indices of the placeholders is within their immediate parent.

Then it gets compiled into the optimized form:

```js
export let c = [["Welcome to ", [0, "the app ", 0], ", ", [1], "!"]]
```

And depending on the adapter, the code is transformed into:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="JSX">
    Uses a simple [`WuchaleTrans` implementation](https://github.com/wuchalejs/wuchale/blob/main/packages/jsx/src/runtime.tsx) (JSX)
    ```jsx
    <p>
        <WuchaleTrans
            tags={[
                _w_ctx_ => <i key="_0">{_w_runtime_.tx(_w_ctx_, [appName])}</i>,
                () => <b key="_0">{userName}</b>,
            ]}
            ctx={_w_runtime_.cx(0)}
        />
    </p>
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Svelte">
    Uses a simple [`WuchaleTrans` implementation](https://github.com/wuchalejs/wuchale/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/runtime.svelte) (Svelte)
    ```svelte
    <p>
        {#snippet wuchaleSnippet0(_w_ctx_)}
            <i>{_w_runtime_.tx(_w_ctx_, [appName])}</i>
        {/snippet}
        {#snippet wuchaleSnippet1()}
            <b>{userName}</b>
        {/snippet}
        <WuchaleTrans tags={[wuchaleSnippet0, wuchaleSnippet1]} ctx={_w_runtime_.cx(0)} />
    </p>
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Basically, the `WuchaleTrans` does the same simple job: looping through the
elements of the array and rendering them. This makes it very performant by
avoiding string manipulations during runtime.

**Note**: Nesting is not restricted to just two levels, you can nest as deep as
you want, and it will nest `WuchaleTrans` components within `WuchaleTrans`
components to work with your code. The result will be the same behaviour as
your code but internationalized.

## Escaping

When compiling the translations, you may think, how do I escape special
characters like `<>{}`? `wuchale` comes with its own message compiler that is
very strict, so strict that it makes escaping unnecessary. If the message is
valid in the PO syntax, it should work.

The way it works is this: it only considers valid numeric tags and numeric
references as special, nothing else. And it is not tolerant to whitespace
mistakes.

### Numeric tags

Example: `<0>...</0>` and `</0>`

These are the only supported syntax to signal nested content. And outside of
translations, they are not valid HTML anyway. That means you can, for example,
extract HTML without a problem, which may be stored in a string (extracted if
the heuristic allows).

```po
msgid "<b>the number 0</b> < <i><0>the number 1</0></i>"
msgstr ""
```

You would think that the above would need escaping but it doesn't when using
`wuchale` because it is very strict. It only considers the `<0>...</0>` as
special and treats the rest as text.

### Numeric references

Example: `{0}`

These are used to reference the expression values in interpolations. Also you
will almost never use them in other contexts and therefore it recognizes them
as special. For example,

```po
msgid "You may use { and } freely and {a} is not special. {0} is, { 0 } is not"
msgstr ""
```

In the above, everything except `{0}` is just text and will not cause problems.
