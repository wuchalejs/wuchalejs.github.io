title: Context
---

To disambiguate identical texts or to give more details, we can use the comment
to give it the context and they will be extracted separately with their own
contexts which can help the translator later.

```svelte
<!-- @wc-context: navigation -->
<button>Home</button>

<!-- @wc-context: building -->
<span>Home</span>
```
