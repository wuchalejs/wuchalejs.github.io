title: File Structure
description: Understand wuchale's file structure - discover how .po catalogs, compiled .compiled.js files, and loader/proxy scripts work together for efficient internationalization.

`wuchale` writes files in the following way:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- vite.config.js
- src
    - locales
        - en.po Source catalog
        - es.po Translation catalog
        - data.js Data file to import e.g. locales from
        - main.loader.server.svelte.js Loader file for client side
        - main.loader.svelte.js Loader file for client side
        - main.url.js Exports URL related functions
        - .wuchale
            - main.main.en.compiled.js Compiled catalog
            - main.main.es.compiled.js
            - main.proxy.js Proxy for async catalog loading
            - main.proxy.sync.js Proxy for sync catalog loading
            - main.urls.js [URL manifest](/guides/urls) file
    - App.svelte Your components
</FileTree>

The files under `.wuchale` are generated/overwritten as needed and should be `.gitignore`d.

The files directly in `locales`

- Obviously you need to commit the `.po` files, those are sources of truth for all translations.
- If you want to control the [loader logic](/guides/loading) and have set `custom` as the loader value in the adapter config, you have to commit the loader files. Otherwise, you can ignore them, they are (re)written at startup.
- The other files files are (re)written at startup and can be ignored.

If you configure it to write the transformed code as well, it will write it to
`src/locales/.output/` or the `outDir` you configure.
