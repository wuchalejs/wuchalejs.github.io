## Process

The process consists of four main stages. We will take the following code as an example:

```svelte
<!-- foo.svelte -->
<p>Hello</p>
```

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

And let's assume that we want to have two locales, English (`en`, source locale) and Spanish (`es`).

### Extract and transform

This is the main stage. For each source file, the contents are parsed using the
suitable parser into an AST representation. Then, two things are done.

#### Extraction

Extractable texts are extracted into the [catalogs](/concepts/catalogs#po-files). From the above example, this is extracted:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="es.po">
        ```nginx
        msgid "Hello"
        msgstr ""
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="en.po">
        ```nginx
        msgid "Hello"
        msgstr "Hello"
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Transformation

The source file is modified to replace the texts with a calls that access the
translations from the [compiled catalogs](/concepts/catalogs#compiled-catalogs).
The example is transformed into:

```svelte
<script>
    import _w_rt_ from '../locales/loader.svelte.js'
    const _w_runtime_ = _w_rt_('main')
</script>
<p>{_w_runtime_.t(0)}</p>
```

The `0` given to the `.t(0)` call is the index of the text. This is how
`wuchale` avoids the use of string/hash keys which would unnecessarily bloat
the bundles.

### Translate

Now that the extracted texts are available, they can be translated. The
translation can be done on the fly using [Gemini](/guides/gemini) or by
exchanging the catalogs witha a translator.

In the example, only Spanish needs to be translated.

```diff lang="nginx"
# es.po
msgid "Hello"
-msgstr ""
+msgstr "Hola"
```

### Compile

Now both catalogs get compiled into compact JavaScript modules that can be loaded and imported in the code.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="en.compiled.js">
        ```js
        export const data = ['Hello']
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="es.compiled.js">
        ```js
        export const data = ['Hola']
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use

Now the compiled catalogs can be loaded and used inside the code. The loading
can be done in [many different ways](/guides/loading). `wuchale` makes sure
that the indices of the texts inside the compiled catalogs matches those inside
the transformed modules so that the correct text is shown at runtime.
